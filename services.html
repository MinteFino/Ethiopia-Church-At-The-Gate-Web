    <h1>Youth Program</h1>
    <p>
        Our student-led ministries are dedicated to helping middle and high school students grow 
        in a meaningful and lasting relationship with Jesus. We understand that the teenage years 
        are a crucial time for spiritual and personal development, so we strive to create a safe, 
        inclusive environment where every student feels seen, valued, and supported.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through age-appropriate and engaging programs, we provide opportunities for students to 
        explore God's Word, ask real questions, and build authentic community. Our weekly gatherings 
        combine fun activities with relevant teaching and small group discussions that connect faith 
        to everyday life.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our ultimate goal is to help students grow in their faith, discover their unique gifts and 
        talents, and become bold leaders who can impact their world for Christ in their schools, 
        communities, and beyond.
